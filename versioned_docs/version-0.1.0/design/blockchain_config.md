# Blockchain Config


## Block time
We'd like to initial have a 30 seconds blocktime. This can ensure about 60 seconds transactions confirmation time which is reasonable for the first stage of the project. In the future, L2 tech can speed up transaction confirmation.

## Validators Deposit Amount
KarmaCoin uses a dPOS consensus algorithm. Validators need to acquire KCoins from the KarmaCoin foundation (or from any other KCoins cold holder) in order to obtain the coins deposit requirement. Deposit size will be determined at later time in a way that is low enough to allow for non-rich validators and high-enough to ensure skin-in-the-game from validators. The KarmaCoin foundation will conduct coin auctions for validators to enable them to purchase coins in an open market context where the coin price is discovered by the market. 

## Sudo
KarmaCoin blockchain includes a Sudo account to perform blockchain maintenance while the the tech is experimental and the product is in beta. The goal is to remove the Sudo account via governance when the blockchain is ready for full decentralization operation.

## Governance
A governance decision is needed for the eventual removal of Sudo.
A governance decision is to perform a blockchain runtime updates.
A governance is needed for KarmaCoin consensus rules updates.
