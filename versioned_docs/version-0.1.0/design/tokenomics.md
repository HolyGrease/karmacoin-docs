# Tokenomics

## Coin types
- `KCents` - basic accounting unit.
- `KCoins ($KC)` - The core Karmacoin cryptocurrency. One KCoin equals one million KCents.
- `KStable $KST` - The KarmaCoin stable-coin cryptocurrency. This stable coin will be issued post-genesis on the KarmaCoin blockchain.
---

## Supply
- Supply is capped at 2.5 billion KCoins (2.5 trillion KCents). 

## Pre-minting Allocations
- 20% of the supply (0.5 Billion KCoins) is pre-minted on genesis.
- 50% of the pre-minted supply (250M KCoins) goes to the KarmaCoin foundation and is used to build the platform.
- 50% of the pre-minted supply (250M KCoins) goes to Karmacoin investors and is vested over a period of 5 years from genesis.

## Karma Mining
The KramaCoin protocol tokenomics are designed to encourage usage and growth in the early days of the network with the goal of estalbihsing KarmaCoin as a global means ot tipping and payments. 
75% of the capped supply (1.5B KCoins) are distributed by the protocol and awarded to users to encourage sign-ups, usage as means of payment and appreciation. We call this Karma mining.

#### Signup Rewards
- Upon sign-up, the protocol mints a 10 KCoins reward to each new user with a verified mobile number. 
- The first 40 million users who join the platform gets this award. 
- The next 100 million users who use get 1 KCoin on signup. This is called `signup rewards`. 
- A total of 500 million KCoins is allocated by the protocol for signup rewards.

#### Referral Rewards
- The protocol mints 10 KCoin for a user who invited a new person that signed-up to the service, up to 40 million invites. 
- The protocol mints 1 KCoin for a user who invited a new person that signed-up to the service for the next 60 million invites.
- A total of 500 million KCoins is allocated by the protocol for referral rewards.

#### Karma Rewards
- Each month, the protocol mints 100 KCoins to the top 1,000 users with the highest Karma coins that didn't get this award yet. 
- Up to 250M KCoins are allocated for this reward. When these have been allocated the protocol stops rewarding users with top karam.

#### Transaction Fees Subsidies
- The protocol rewards up 250M KCoins to users payment transactions over 10 years period in the form of transaction fees subsidies. 
- Transaction susedies are minted by the protocol for payment transactions and are given to block producers. When a subsedy is applied, the user who submitted the transaction doesn't pay the transaction fee.
- These intentional design decision designed to encourage sign-ups, appreciation, and coin usage in the real-world as means of payment.

## Treasury
The Karmacoin foundation is going to allocate 10M KCoins to an on-chain treasury that will be used to reward various stakeholders for behavior that advances the Karmacoin community, usage and values.

## Bounty Rewards Pool
The Karmacoin foundation is going to allocate 10M KCoins from its pre-minted coins to reward execution of technical tasks such as audits and bug reports. This pool is going to be managed on-chain for maximum transparency.

## Validator Awards
- 25% of the capped supply (500M KCoins) are allocated by the protocol to rewards the Karmacoin blockchain validators. These are minting by the protocol over a 10 years period using a decay curve which rewards validators who starts validating early while still rewarding new validators that join the system over time.

## Validators Deposit
KarmaCoin uses a dPOS consensus algorithm. Validators need to acquire KCoins from the KarmaCoin foundation (or from any other KCoins cold holder) in order to obtain the coins deposit requirement. The minimum validator deposit amount is 50,000 KCoins. It is designed in a way that is low enough to allow for non-rich validators and high-enough to ensure skin-in-the-game from validators and stake that has non-negligible fiat value. The KarmaCoin foundation will conduct coin auctions for validators to enable them to purchase coins in an open market context where the coin price is discovered by the market.

## Investors Funds
Karmacoin investors founds are going to be managed on-chain by a vesting mechanism that enables them to pull vested funds according to their vesting schedule.
