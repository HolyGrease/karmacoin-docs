# Tokenomics

## Coin types
- `KCents` - basic accounting unit.
- `KCoins ($KC)` - The core Karmacoin cryptocurrency. One KCoin equals one thousand KCents.
- `KCoinsStable $KCS` - The KarmaCoin stable-coin cryptocurrency. This stable coin will be issued post-genesis on the KarmaCoin blockahin.
---

## Supply
- Supply is capped at 2 billion KCoins (2 trillion Kcents). The coins is minted by the protocol over a 10 years period based on the number of users on the system.

## Pre-minting Allocations
- 20% of supply (0.4 Billion Kcoins) is pre-minted on genesis.
- 50% of the pre-minted supply (0.2B KCoins) goes to the Karmacoin foundation and is used to build the platform.
- 50% of the pre-minted supply (0.2B KCoins) goes to Karmacoin investors and is vested over a period of 5 years from genesis.

## Karma Mining

- 50% of the capped supply (1B KCoins) are minted by the protocol and awarded to users to encourage sign-ups, usage as means of payment and appreciation. We call this Karma mining.

### Karma Mining - Minting Rules
- Upon sign-up, the protocol mints 10 KCoins to each new user with a verified mobile number. The first 10 million users who join the platform gets this award. The next 100 million users who use get 1 KCoin on signup. A total of 200 million KCoins is allocated by the protocol for this minting.
- The protocol mints 10 KCoin for user who invited a new person who signed-up to the service, up to 100 million invites. 
The total allocation for this minting by the protocol is 1B KCoins.
- Each month, the protocol mints 100 KCoins to the top 1000 users with the highest Karma coins that didn't get this award yet. Up to 700M KCoins are allocated for this reward. When these have been allocated the protocol stops rewarding users with top karam.
- The protocol rewards 100M KCoins to users who use the coin for transactions over 10 years period in the form of transactions incentives. Transaction incentives are rewards awarded to the user who transfers coins to another user in the form of minting of the transaction fee instead of the user paying it.
- These intentional design decision designed to encourage sign-ups, appreciation, and coin usage in the real-world as means of payment. 
- 

## Validator Awards
- 0.6B KCoins are allocated by the protocol to rewards the Karmacoin blockchain validators. These are minting by the protocol over a 10 years period using a decay curve which rewards validators who starts validating early while still rewarding new validators that join the system over time.
