# Polkadot UI

## Create Accounts
- To start nominating, you need to create a `Stash account`.
- The `Stash account` is where you keep most of your coins. It is the custodian of your staking funds.
- You can use any Substrate-compatible wallet to create these accounts. We recommend using the [polkadot.js extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd). Refer to this guide [Create an Account using Polkadot JS Extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy7lvAqyzkY) for more information about using the extension.

4. Using your `Stash account`, initial bond amount (at least 5 KCoins) and description (it is better to provide some URL link where users can find more information about your pool), then submit transaction.
