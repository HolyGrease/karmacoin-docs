### Are there already commitments to validate Karmachain 2.0 mainnet?
Yes, as of May 23, we have commitments from several organizations to validate Karmachain 2.0 mainnet. Our goal is to decentralize and secure Karmachain by having at least 10 validator on genesis. 

### Why should I become a validator?
You should become a validator if your organization is aligned with the Karma Coin cryptocurrency values and mission, believe that Karma Coins are going to be valuable in the future, and want to see Karma Coin successful and used by millions of people worldwide. By becoming a validator you provide security and contribute to the decentralization of the Karma Coin cryptocurrency.

### How do I become a validator?
To become a validator you need to purchase a Karma Coins stake from the Karma Coin development company and plan to run a Karma Coin validator blockchain node on the Karma Coin blockchain testnet and mainnet.

### Can I become a nominator?
Yes, the Karma Coin blockchain supports the nominator role.

### How are validators nominated?
Until there are 1,000 unique validators, an organization that stakes the minimum staking amount becomes a validator and no further nomination is needed. In case there will be more than 1,000 validators, the top 1,000 nominated organizations will be validators using on-chain nominations.

### When are you planning to launch a public Testnet?
The Karmachain 2.0 public testnet has launched in May 2023.

### How can I test Karmachain validation?
