### What is the Karma Coin Blockchain Consensus Protocol?
The Karma Coin blockchain uses a nominated proof of stake (NpOS) consensus protocol. Specifically, the BABE and GRANDPA consensus protocols from Parity tech. These are the same protocols used by projects such as Polkadot, Kusama and several others.

### Why should I become a validator?
You should become a validator if your organization is aligned with the Karma Coin cryptocurrency values and mission, believe that Karma Coins are going to be valuable in the future, and want to see Karma Coin successful and used by millions of people worldwide. By becoming a validator you provide security and contribute to the decentralization of the Karma Coin cryptocurrency.

### How do I become a validator?
To become a validator you need to purchase a Karma Coins stake from the Karma Coin development company and plan to run a Karma Coin validator blockchain node on the Karma Coin blockchain testnet and mainnet.

### How do I obtain the coins for staking?

### What is the minimum staking amount?
The minimum staking amount required to become a validator is 500,000 Karma Coins.

### What is a validator genesis partner?

Until there are 1,000 unique validators, an organization that stakes the minimum staking amount becomes a validator and no further nomination is needed. In case there will be more than 1,000 validators, the top 1,000 nominated organizations will be validators using on-chain nominations.
